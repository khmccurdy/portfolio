                    <h4>Web of States of a Cell-Based Game</h4>

                        These graphs represent the connections between distinct turn states of two different
                        levels of a game. Arrows connect states reachable by one move. Each state may lead to 
                        at most 3 other states, but can be reached by an arbitrary number of other states. 
                        Dark arrows connect to new states (efficient moves), while light arrows connect to 
                        previously enumerated states (inefficient moves). The states are enumerated by the number
                        and sequence of moves required to reach each game state, e.g. a state that takes 5
                        moves to reach will always be clockwise from a state that takes 2 moves to reach. 
                        The most efficient sequence of moves leading to a particular state is highlighted in red
                        on mouse-over.

                        Each graph is generated using JavaScript, D3, and SVG based on a JavaScript object
                        containing game state data for its respective level. Additional visualizations based
                        on the source of this dataset include a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BjLwaPMBZkD/?taken-by=khmccurdy" target="_blank">
